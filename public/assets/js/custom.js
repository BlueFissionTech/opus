The municipality spent a substantial budget on rebuilding and the area businesses aren't excited about the prospect of calling their insurance providers about another broken window they won't pay for. No, they are determined to scare away another riot before the idea even pops into these kids' rebellious heads. The vehicle slows to a coasting speed and I realize we're approaching a roadblock. My handheld is permanently set to “deny all connections” since it doesn't count as an illegal search if your device willingly latches on to a friendly-looking police checkpoint beacon. After all, maybe they don't actually want to rummage through your private conversations. Maybe they just want to share a photo announcement of Deputy Gill's thirty-fifth birthday bash with you or some bullshit.",

Grabbing my laptop bag I secure the straps and make sure it's zipped tight and the water-proof lip is folded down. Much like with a device, it's fair game if they can easily look inside. If a cop peeks in at a checkpoint and sees any “suspicious” items in your bag, they can command the Port to pull over, order you out, and dig through your bags without penalty. Better to make sure they can't see anything inside the bag at all. This time it pays to tuck your things away and bury your secrets. At least that way there are no legal grounds on which I can be called out for it.",

Sure, I look less discrete and stick out a little more. A casually open bag in the seat beside me would indeed look more innocent, but just for fun, the checkpoint officer might say he sees an illegal weapon or a bottle of dubious pills or any other faux fiction that gets his hand into my possessions. The worst part, I can't remember if I happen to actually have either on my person today. Better to find out in the privacy of my apartment. The cab rolls up and pauses just long enough for the checkpoint monitor to remote scan my ID. Nothing comes up. Not for what they're looking for, anyway. Still, the auto-cab doesn't pick up speed but instead just sits there for several more uncomfortable seconds. Of course I get picked for a “random inspection” by the recommender. Typical.",

My first instinct is to shake my head, lean back, and close my eyes, but I don't, knowing damn well that this cab won't move until he checks the all-clear on the monitor. I don't want any trouble tonight, so I press the button to roll down the window glass. He bends over, peeks his head in, and squints while panning a flashlight across the inside cabin. He's silent and so am I. I've got nothing to say to him. With one final pass, he shines the light in my face, and out of resentment alone I don't blink, despite the searing near laser blast of white LED in my pupils. Then he pulls his head out and stands back up. I take a moment to relax as the monitor blinks green and the cab responds. It speeds and moves on leaving the checkpoint behind. Then it zooms past the last shop in the district and we pass through the historic homes on our way to the river.",

It takes a left, goes a mile, hangs a right, the bridge is down so it continues. The riverfront lights shimmer on the edge of the water and the wheels beneath me hum over the vibrating grate of the bridge. On the other end of this floating outstretched metal roadway are a series of business parks and workforce apartments in a glowing row of monolithic high rises. That skyline flickers with its own lights, also bouncing their illumination off of the river's surface. They speak a different language, though. Downtown, the lights glow in the dialect of fast-talking street buskers. These have the same accent as hospital fluorescents and airport terminal windows at night. On one side, vibrant and alive. On the other, sterile, clinical, and pragmatic.",
